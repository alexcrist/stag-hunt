## IDEAS

### The race

Make the stag-hunt a race to get points. Each player is not racing against one another, but aganist a global scoreboard. A rabbit is worth 1 point, a stag is worth 10 points. Once a player gets 100 points, their time is recorded and entered into a global stag-hunt leaderboard. Although each player is working individually, they should go for the stag together to each get faster times. This hopefully emulates the stag-hunt situation realistically.


### More games

Create a suite of stag-hunt style games for different game theory games (just games with Nash equilibria that can involve cooperation rather than only defection)
